Dice Roller - Player 1 vs Player 2
This is the first project I've created since starting to learn development.
It uses everything I've learned so far (HTML, CSS, JS) for a dice roller/randomiser with a 'winner' display.
This project was a chance to practice and utilise functions, variables, DOM, and if loops.
